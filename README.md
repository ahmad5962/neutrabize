# neutrabize
A chrome extension to customise your new tab

## What you can do
For starters, whatever you want!

But, you can change your name in the `nav` where it says `./` by default. If you click on it, you will be able to enter your own name. That name will be stored locally (see the scripts for more) and then it'll be shown instead of the default `./`.

------

More features like, *changing the background* or even selecting an entire directory/folder and change the background after a specified time, and *changing the greeting message* like we can change the name (i know this one doesn't even need any extra work but it is what it is) will be added soon.
